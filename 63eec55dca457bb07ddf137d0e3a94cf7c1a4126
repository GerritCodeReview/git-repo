      "message": "sorry, but i don\u0027t see this happening.  there are many OS\u0027s beyond Linux, and many distros beyond Debian \u0026 Fedora, so we cannot make changes that require those.  some are only installing `python`, not `python2` or `python3` (where `python` is Python 3).\n\nthis also seems to go against PEP-0394:\nhttps://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/\n\nthe reason we can migrate all the other shebangs is because they are not executed directly.  only the repo launcher is shipped to end users.  so making the assumption/requirement that `python3` is available isn\u0027t a big deal because the subset of devs hacking on repo are fine with it.",
