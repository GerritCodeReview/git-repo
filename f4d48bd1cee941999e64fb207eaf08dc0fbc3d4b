      "message": "I agree with the above comments. I will take a shot at answering some of the questions (I could be wrong in my opinion).\n\n\u003e do we plan on leaving this check/warning in here long term ? \nIMO, no.\n\n\u003e what is the goal of this check ? \nWe wanted to know if git submodules doesn\u0027t know of some projects. We had also seen sometimes there was a lag (in sync\u0027ing). This is to point out all the issues before we switch to git submodues.\n\n\u003e  it\u0027s not about a bug in repo itself right ? \nRight. It is not because of a bug in the repo code.\n\n\u003e it\u0027s a problem with the superproject generation ?  \nYes.\n\n\u003e do we think we\u0027d change repo behavior to workaround these missing commits\nAn option could be, we should default to the old behavior if there is a missing commit.\n\n\u003e would it always be on the service maintaining/creating this superproject to fix things ?\n\nIMO, until, we don\u0027t have any reports, we can not make --use-superproject the default. We should revert back to the BUG_URL.\n\nI will add the above comments to the internal bug (and I will write a design document with the above questions). Thanks for asking the above questions.",
