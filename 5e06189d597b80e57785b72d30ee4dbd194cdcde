      "message": "I have sent two patch sets, where the first one continues to use `unittest`-style tests, and the second one uses Pytest-style tests with parametrization. The second one cuts down on lines of code a lot, and Pytest is already used for running the tests in the project so it works without other modifications, but since it is far from the style of existing tests I let the maintainers prefer one style or the other.",
