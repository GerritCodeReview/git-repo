      "message": "I am not comfortable with doing that. I have only changed two of the callers of `_ParseList()` to use sets. Changing the other four would affect superprojects, submanifests and enabled-lists for hooks. enabled-lists is easy enough, it would just require to sort them when outputting the XML. However, I cannot tell how superprojects and submanifests would be affected by changing from lists to sets. We do not use either, and AFAICT, there are no unit tests for submanifests.",

      "message": "there is a lot of code that is, unfortunately, not unittested.  that should not be used as an excuse to only touch parts that have clear unittest coverage.  we don\u0027t want partial migrations that never complete.\n\ni agree that `_ParseList()` should stay as-is because it\u0027s used by more than just groups (e.g. hooks), although all users currently should also be sets.\n\nif we\u0027re converting project groups to be a set, it needs to ripple out to all places where project groups are managed, and that includes the submanifest parts.  if it breaks, we\u0027ll fix it.  if it\u0027s broken and no one complains, that\u0027ll be a good reason to delete the code entirely.",

      "message": "Understood. I have gone through the code again, and I think I now have enough understanding of the parts I did not dare to touch before so that I could adapt them as well. I introduced a `_ParseSet()` method (which simply calls `set(self._ParseList(fields))`) to make it more obvious where sets are expected. I also added two new commits to rename a couple of references to \"groups\" to make it more obvious what kind of groups are being referred. At least they made it a lot easier for me to untangle this.",
