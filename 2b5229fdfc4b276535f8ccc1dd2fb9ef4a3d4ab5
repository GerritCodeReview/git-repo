My current plan for end-to-end testing is to write the fix that seems like it should work, then publish a new repo version, then try to led-launch a staging build that we know actually broke.",

      "message": "The runtime is worth talking about. We\u0027re checking whether every project is relative to every other project. This runs in O(n^2) time (where `n\u003dlen(projects)`). ChromeOS has 1,000 projects. That\u0027s... gnarly.\n\nOne way we could improve this is by introducing an annotation to the manifest XML, like `\u003cannotation name\u003d\"is_nested\" value\u003d\"true\"\u003e`. Runtime would decrease to O(n + k*n), where `k` is the number of nested projects. Assuming `k` is very small, it\u0027s just O(n).\n\nThe downside of this approach is that we wouldn\u0027t proactively catch this problem every time; manifest maintainers would be responsible for annotating their own nested checkouts. I don\u0027t think we can expect all users to do that rigorously.",
