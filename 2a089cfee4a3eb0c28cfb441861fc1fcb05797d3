      "message": "Hrmm, this somehow affected my coreboot repo and left it in a broken state.\n\nMy coreboot repo had a manually created worktree that was tracking coreboot upstream. I unfortunately no longer have the previous state since my scrollback lost it. But it looked like most of the symlinks were deleted, but not all of them. I suspect there was an error thrown. I don\u0027t know what it was since I run `repo sync` in a cron job...\n\nThis is more of an FYI, in case anyone else runs into problems.",
