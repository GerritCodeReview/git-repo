      "message": "Always passing this option can cause the history to become disconnected. Suppose a client initializes with depth\u003d1 and gets the current branch. Then the project moves forward 25 commits. When the client does a repo sync to pick up the latest history, he will get exactly 1 commit again, and miss the 24 intervening commits. Git can\u0027t connect the commit we already have with the commit it just got, so the project goes to having exactly 1 commit again.\n\nBut if the project moves forward only 1 commit, the fetch will work and the history is connected.\n\nI think you only want this flag on the initial fetch in this repository.",
