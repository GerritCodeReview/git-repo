      "message": "Why not use project.Sync_NetworkHalf() for this?\n\nAlso, it would be better (and more consistent with other commands, like \"rebase\" and \"sync\") to have an option to compare *only* to the locally fetched refs, instead of always forcing a network requirement.  E.g., have the option to do --local-only (like sync does).  Or even better IMO:  remove this capability altogether, instead forcing the user to run \"repo sync --network-only\" *first*, if he wants to see the most up to date version.  Otherwise it\u0027ll use just what was fetched last.",

      "message": "This assumes that the remote name is \"origin\", which may be the default, but is not a requirement in the manifest (our manifests use \"gerrit\" as the remote name, and therefore none of our projects use an \"origin\" remote).  This would never work in that case.\n\nGerrit uses \"refs/remotes/m/*\" to refer to all the remote branches, and git will be able to map it back to the correct ref automatically.  E.g., I can use \"git log --oneline m/master..\" and it works fine, without me having to tell this command or gerrit that my remote name is \"gerrit\", because it\u0027s already mapped that way:\n\n$ git branch -r\n  gerrit/master\n  m/master -\u003e gerrit/master",
