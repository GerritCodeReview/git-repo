      "message": "i like the idea.  some high level thoughts:\n\n* the description \u0026 similar chapters are not being emitted correctly.  look at repo-init as an example.  can we tune the output to get help2man to process these correctly ?\n* we\u0027d prefer python scripts over shell scripts.  i know update-manpages is a bit simple, but i don\u0027t want to give a style/correctness review on it because it won\u0027t be pretty ;).\n* running these in serial takes ~10 sec.  running them in parallel on my system takes ~1 sec.  i know these won\u0027t be updated regularly, but if we could process them in parallel, it\u0027d be nicer for local testing \u0026 spot checks.",
