      "message": "The more correct path (not followed because of the P0 corruption issue) would have been:\n 1. Add `--auto-gc` and `--no-auto-gc` flag, with the default set to `--auto-gc`.\n 2. Wait a period of time, so that users can update and explicitly state the behavior that they want.\n 3. Change the default to `--no-quto-gc`.\n \nIn cases where we explicitly add a flag *and* introduce a change in default behavior, adding the environment variable option allows the user to accomplish the same thing.  Now that v2.30 is marked stable, I will prepare a change that marks the envvar as deprecated and \"to be removed\", and we can remove it completely in a future release.",
