      "message": "I\u0027m wondering if this whole mechanism of manually establishing and closing the ControlMaster can be replaced by just setting ssh options\n\n```\nControlMaster auto \nControlPersist 10m\nControlPath ...something%r@%h-%p\n``` \n\nThen the first connection will automatically create the master and subsequent connection use it.\n\nIf holding the connection open 10min after a sync is too much, it can be force closed with `ssh -O exit` \n\n----------------\n\nBy doing that, the first connection will be created by git and any environment variables set by git forwarded there, without extra logic added below.\n\n--------------\n\nMaybe this is not the best place to discuss. Should i open a ticket or create a second patch with such proposal? Or do you already know if this path has been explored before and is a dead end?",
