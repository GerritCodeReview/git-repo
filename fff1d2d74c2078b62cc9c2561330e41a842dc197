      "message": "I\u0027m wondering if this whole mechanism of manually establishing and closing the ControlMaster can be replaced by just setting ssh options\n\n```\nControlMaster auto \nControlPersist 10m\nControlPath ...something%r@%h-%p\n``` \n\nThen the first connection will automatically create the master and subsequent connection use it.\n\nIf holding the connection open 10min after a sync is too much, it can be force closed with `ssh -O exit` \n\n----------------\n\nBy doing that, the first connection will be created by git and any environment variables set by git forwarded there, without extra logic added below.\n\n--------------\n\nMaybe this is not the best place to discuss. Should i open a ticket or create a second patch with such proposal? Or do you already know if this path has been explored before and is a dead end?",

      "message": "a bug would be good as it\u0027ll be a better paper trail\n\npart of the problem we try to cater to people who are not that savvy.  often times they\u0027re given some insns to copy \u0026 paste and they don\u0027t really understand what\u0027s going on.  trying to get them to configure ssh_config for automatic master support is prob too much for many.\n\nthat said, if there\u0027s something in newer tools that we can switch to, perhaps with degrading much older tools, i think we\u0027d be open to that.  i see git-2.3.0 supports `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` and that was released in 2015.  our soft requirement is git-1.9.1 from 2014.  so making that range less optimal, but still functional, is OK.\n\nbut let\u0027s land this CL as it\u0027s a bit less intrusive.",
