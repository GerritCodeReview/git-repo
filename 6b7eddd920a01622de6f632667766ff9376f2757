      "message": "distros that ship a repo package do the modification during install to customize based on their env/configs.  it helps align policy choices.  it doesn\u0027t help if you want to ship a distro-independent wrapper though :/.\n\ni think the automatic re-exec for python3 is still helpful.  it bridges the gap if `python` or `python3` on the system is an older version, but a newer one is installed.  this will be recurring for us as we move Python 3 versions.  we had 3.4, then 3.5, and now 3.6 as the min version.  we won\u0027t be on 3.6 forever.  it might be that right now we\u0027re using 3.6-specific syntax that 3.5 and older don\u0027t recognize, but that isn\u0027t always the case.",
