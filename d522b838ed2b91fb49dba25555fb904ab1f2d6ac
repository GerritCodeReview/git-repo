      "message": "That makes a lot of sense. By that I assume you mean storing the setting in the manifest project config. I\u0027ll work towards that.\n\nI find nothing that prevents using `repo init` with both --mirror and --depth. Adding --shallow-mirror which would work with both --depth and depth settings for each project (in the manifest) sounds good to me.\n\nLet me know if you have other ideas or suggestions.",
