How do we want to conclude that it\u0027s an absolute URI? \n\nI\u0027ve added some context to the previous comment and I\u0027m open to suggestions as to how to approach this here, but it seems like what we\u0027re doing right now is open to some inherent weirdness w.r.t how urllib handles this given the current configuration.",

      "message": "If we wanted to support the `alternative scp-like syntax`, identifying that it\u0027s that syntax and supporting it without needing the attribute would be ideal. Maybe by automatically converting it to a ssh url to ensure any other future operations work.\n\nIt looks like git parses these by first [checking for](https://github.com/git/git/blob/d4a83d07b8cc66d4afac2f33a8af729f2ba93bba/connect.c#L1084) `://` for urls, then using [this logic](https://github.com/git/git/blob/d4a83d07b8cc66d4afac2f33a8af729f2ba93bba/connect.c#L696) to differentiate between ssh and local paths.  But since we\u0027re supporting relative paths, we can\u0027t support local path overrides here (you can still use `file://`), so something similar could differentiate between ssh paths and relative paths.",
