I have found there is around 10 minutes for the first time \"repo sync --use-superproject\" and less than 5 secs for subsequent \"repo sync --use-superproject\". Ian and I are going to test this change after one day to see if it has any negative performance impacts.\n\n \"git clone --filter\u003dblob:none\" (_without_ --depth option)",
