      "message": "It occurred to me that a project tagged as \"notdefault\" ... that is part of an included manifest with a tagged group, will then be included much in the same way as if it was not \"notdefault\".\n\nMaybe I should add special handling for that, so a notdefault project should not get tagged unless you specifically set that project (as it behaves when not getting include-tagged)?",
