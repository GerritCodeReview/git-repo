      "message": "I wonder if the name repo-manifest.default.url/server is better. Then we have the configuration file saying:\n\n  [repo-manifest \"default\"]\n    url \u003d ...\n    server \u003d ...\n\nI could see users defining other aliases in the future, like:\n\n  [repo-manifest \"android\"]\n    url \u003d git://android.git.kernel.org/platform/manifest.git\n\nAnd then repo supporting these \"alias\" names with -u:\n\n  repo init -u android\n\nWhere we simply use \"default-manifest\" as the default alias when the user doesn\u0027t supply a -u flag at all. Its not a big change relative to what you already have done, and may be a useful feature for users who often work with 2 or 3 manifests.",

I would also propose to have the \u0027reference\u0027 included in this section, as they are often different when working with different manifests (yup, I\u0027m one of those that have at least 3 manifests I work with)\n\nI\u0027ll upload a proposal with these changes done (including the \u0027reference\u0027)",
