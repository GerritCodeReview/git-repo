Does it make more sense to permit editing the remote during `repo manifest -o` with an option to the manifest output command, rather than having to swing in a temporary local_manifest.xml to support the rewrite?",

      "message": "When rewriting, we generally remove the internal remote, add a new remote (with a different name), and edit the default to point to the new remote.  There is enough information necessary for the new remote (url, review url) that I figured it would be easier to put in xml than on the command line.\n\nAlso, I generally need to inject a project when rewriting, so I\u0027m already using a local_manifest.xml.",
