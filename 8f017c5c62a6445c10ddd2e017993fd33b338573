Basically you\u0027ll download the new manifest, but you won\u0027t actually use it until the *next* repo sync call made by the user, which is wrong.\n\nYou need to do mp.Sync_NetworkHalf(), and then after that do this if mp.HasChanges: SyncLocalHalf, then reload the manifest and get all projects, and *then* add them to the to_fetch list.",
