      "message": "saving |glob| in _Repo._ParseArgs to |gopts| seems like the easiest route.  but i think that ends up not being correct because of how you want to use these things.  options like --event-log take a path which can be relative, but you\u0027re running repo in a diff dir which will break those relative paths.  so your only option is to reconstruct \u0026 normalize path arguments in the process.\n\nchromite has a custom FilteringParser that extends optparse.OptionParser so that it can capture arguments and replay them later, but it requires a bit of boiler plate, and wouldn\u0027t really address the relative path issue.",
