      "message": "my goal is to delete python2 logic this year from the codebase :).  we\u0027ve already started messaging on go/repo-discuss that anyone stuck on python2 should use the repo-1 launcher+branch, and the launcher+main module have been generating warnings whenever you run `repo` that python2 is deprecated and will stop working entirely.\n\nso if i get any reports from people that this breaks in a certain situation when using python2, my answer (conveniently) is to upgrade their python3 because python2 is already EOL and no one supports it.",
