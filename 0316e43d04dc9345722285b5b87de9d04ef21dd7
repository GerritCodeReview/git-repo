      "message": "`chunksize` refers to how many tasks are given to a single worker at once, not how many processes are started. It\u0027s the tradeoff curve between IPC overhead and parallelism. I tested this number with only two processes in the pool and 32 was still optimal among powers of two.\n\nmultiprocessing.Pool defaults to cpu_count() processes, but I can change this to accept a -j argument.",
