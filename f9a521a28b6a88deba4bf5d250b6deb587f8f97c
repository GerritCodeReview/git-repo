If there\u0027s a problem with parse result, then the if block we have on L513 should get skipped.  If not, then I would expect the error should be happening there and we would need to catch the unboundlocalerror.\n\nBasically, parse_result does not come from the .netrc, so something else is going on here then what you are describing.",
