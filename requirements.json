# This file declares various requirements for this version of repo.  The
# launcher script will load it and check the constraints before trying to run
# us.  This avoids issues of the launcher using an old version of Python (e.g.
# 3.5) while the codebase has moved on to requiring something much newer (e.g.
# 3.8).  If the launcher tried to import us, it would fail with syntax errors.

# This is a JSON file with line-level comments allowed.

# Always keep backwards compatibility in mine.  The launcher script is robust
# against missing values, but when a field is renamed/removed, it means older
# versions of the launcher script won't be able to enforce the constraint.

# When requiring versions, always use lists as they are easy to parse & compare
# in Python.  Strings would require futher processing to turn into a list.

# Version constraints should be expressed in pairs: soft & hard.  Soft versions
# are when we start warning users that their software too old and we're planning
# on dropping support for it, so they need to start planning system upgrades.
# Hard versions are when we refuse to work the tool.  Users will be shown an
# error message before we abort entirely.

# When deciding whether to upgrade a version requirement, check out the distro
# lists to see who will be impacted:
# https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo/+/HEAD/docs/release-process.md#Project-References

  # The repo launcher itself.  This allows us to force people to upgrade as some
  # ignore the warnings about it being out of date, or install ancient versions
  # to start with for whatever reason.
  #
  # NB: Repo launchers started checking this file with repo-2.12, so listing
  # versions older than that won't make a difference.
