      "message": "What happens if this Python is built without threads?  If I read the Python documentation right, the \"import threading\" statement is what would blow up.  They suggest:\n\n  try:\n    import threading as _threading\n  except ImportError:\n    import dummy_threading as _threading\n\nBut then they don\u0027t explain what behavior dummy_threading has when you start a function.  Since we\u0027ve never required threading before, I\u0027m a bit leary of making this required even without --jobs being supplied on the command line.",

      "message": "Since this is about reducing sync time through increased parallelism on the network, does it really make sense to sleep 3 seconds during each poll for completion?  Its more effort to code, but it probably makes more sense to use a Condition to wait for completion so the main thread can continue immediately after all fetches are completed.",
