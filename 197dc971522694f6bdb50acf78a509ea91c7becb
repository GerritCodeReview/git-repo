      "message": "Many Android projects switch the upstream source for packages on a frequent basis, particularly shortly after a new major version is released. For example, a project may switch a package from aosp to caf for hardware changes or from aosp to github for local changes. This typically happens with a couple dozen packages in a project. Most developers on a project won\u0027t have any local changes or branches for most of these packages. So it is needlessly cumbersome to require a force sync in these cases.",
