      "message": "This would make it harder to remove deprecated features from Gerrit\u0027s options accepted at push time (since the changes to adapt would have to be made on both branches), so I\u0027m not looking forward to it.\n\nCan you say a little about the difficulty involved in making the codebase work with both Python 2 and Python 3? Also, what obstacles are there to simply requiring Python 3? Even in Red Hat systems there is EPEL.",

      "message": "the current repo release is over 2 years old, so staying in sync doesn\u0027t seem like that big of a problem ?\n\nmy intentions aren\u0027t for the py2 branch to keep in sync with newer Gerrit features.  it\u0027s purely a \"this is frozen in time, much like your distro choice, so it\u0027s best effort\".  so i don\u0027t think we should worry about it falling out of sync.\n\nwrt jumping straight to python3.6, my pessimistic experience is that no matter what we think is reasonable, someone is going to come out of the wood work and complain.  so the python2 branch allows us to punt them over.",

I didn\u0027t get that from the text.\n\nCan you say something like \"maintained on a best-effort basis\" instead of \"bugfix-only\"? The latter over-promises a bit --- the reality is that it\u0027s likely to not even get all the bugfixes.\n\nPerhaps we can go further and say \"Once repo 1.14 is released, Python 2.7 is not supported. If volunteers appear to maintain a branch based on 1.13 then that may happen to give people on old systems some extra time to migrate.\" In other words, there\u0027s only as much support as affected users provide.",
