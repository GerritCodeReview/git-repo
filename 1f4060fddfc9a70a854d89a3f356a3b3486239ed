      "message": "How does this fix anything? Not all subcmds return a result code when they finish executing. Many use sys.exit(1) directly. For example, Abandon. :-)\n\nI\u0027ll admit, our error handling is sort of a mess, and a cop-out by using sys.exit. So I applaud the idea of trying to get better status codes, but I\u0027m not convinced this patch is sufficient.",
