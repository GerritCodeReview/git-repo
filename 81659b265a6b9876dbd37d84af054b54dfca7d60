      "message": "I looked at this introducing change a bit more and I\u0027m a bit concerned it was an intentional change to support non-existent sources (maybe @apetkov86@gmail.com can clarify?). However, if so, that\u0027s a change of behavior from 5 years prior to that change since the existence check was added in [change 68241](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/git-repo/+/68241). Both of those had a risk of breaking existing users, as does this change.\n\nGiven that, I think you want to phrase this as a sentence and refer to both changes by number and explain how the newer change causes a regression for some users:\n```\nThis issue was introduced by change 265736 which modified the behavior\nintroduced as a side effect of change 68241. Thus, from 2008 until June\n2015 links from non-existent files would be created, then from June 2015\nuntil May 2020 links would not be created, and then since May 2020 links\nare created. This change returns to the 2015-2020 behavior.\n```\n\n@sokcevic@google.com and @gavinmak@google.com do you know if there are clients expecting to create links from non-existent files? If there are any, we probably want to control this behavior with a command line flag.",
