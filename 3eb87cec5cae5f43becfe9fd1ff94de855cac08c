      "message": "Yeah with this patch we no longer restore back to repo\u0027s project hooks if the user has modified them (they see \"error: kernel: Not replacing commit-msg hook\", for example).  Do you think this is something that needs to be done?  Seems like if a user is editing their hooks they (hopefully) know what they\u0027re doing and might appreciate repo not stomping on their changes...\n\nI did verify that if a project hook is *removed* it\u0027s restored.\n\nI guess an alternative to dropping this altogether would be to only delete files from the _ProjectHooks() list so that they\u0027re always restored when we call _InitHooks()...  That way at least non project hooks will be left alone (which is what I really care about).",
