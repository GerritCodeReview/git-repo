      "message": "i don\u0027t think this is the right trade-off.  the point of repo is to get a source checkout and let people develop it, and keep it up to date.  if they make a change and it\u0027s merged, they shouldn\u0027t silently get into a wedged state.  the referenced change is addressing that exact scenario.  it isn\u0027t that people are trying to run git rebase themselves.\n\n1. start a branch\n2. create+upload a change\n3. change is merged\n4. local branch never updates because it can\u0027t rebase onto the newer one\n\nnow the dev has a project that is wedged.  repo sync doesn\u0027t fix it, nor does it error.\n\ni made https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/193798453 public since it doesn\u0027t really have any secret details in it.  that way you can see the discussion that lead to the previous change.",
