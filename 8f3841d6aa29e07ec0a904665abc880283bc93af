In most cases folks don\u0027t expect this scenario to work when they ask repo to shallow clone a project. The change I referenced (Ie34c5d860) essentially broke shallow clones with repo when revision is a stale SHA as it ends up doing a full fetch.\n\n\u003e 3. change is merged\n\u003e 4. local branch never updates because it can\u0027t rebase onto the newer one\n\u003e \n\u003e now the dev has a project that is wedged.  repo sync doesn\u0027t fix it, nor does it error.\n\u003e \n\u003e i made https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/193798453 public since it doesn\u0027t really have any secret details in it.  that way you can see the discussion that lead to the previous change.",
