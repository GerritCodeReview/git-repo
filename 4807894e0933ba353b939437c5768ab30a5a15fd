      "message": "This sounds like it does a general bootstrapping, but really it\u0027s just for one variable (since currently that is all that is used) and only when a mirror is available.  I would imagine a general bootstrapping to be equivalent to cloning manifest project to a tmp directory and then using the .gitconfig variables as desired before cloning it a second time (this time preferably from the tmp dir).\n\nAnyway, I guess I\u0027d suggest changing the body of the commit message to be more specific about the `repo.reference` config variable since the subject line of the commit message doesn\u0027t have room to explain that `referenc` is a config variable.",
