      "message": "Looks like we will be mixing depth with clone filter, and that may not be desired (http://b/274340522#comment7). \n\nIIUC, technically we will still be unshallowing, but the experience won\u0027t be as bad with filter option. Instead of patching this edge case and potentially opening more (e.g. sha1 commit hash not used), I wonder if it would make more sense to step back and see if we shouldn\u0027t be using --depth at all and just rely on filters (some kind of design doc will be needed). If not, we should at least update commit message to be more accurate.",

      "message": "We are already mixing depth with the clone filter. My conversations with git-core team seem to indicate that the biggest issue is --depth has some undesirable behavior and shouldn\u0027t be used, and not so much that --depth and --filter are used in combination.\n\nIdeally we would remove --depth altogether from repo, since it\u0027s benefits can be achieved with --filter. The problem is that if we immediately rip out --depth without some sort of replacement we would incur some heavy performance penalty.\n\nThere are multiple things that we can do to address this issues - so a quick doc may be appropriate.",
