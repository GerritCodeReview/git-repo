In order to run this test, you need to install cram [https://bitheap.org/cram/]
$ sudo pip install cram

then just run 'cram cram.t'
it won't output anything useful, except either that nothing failed,
or it will hang forever, since repo never exits when something is wrong
and cram doesnt print the output before it exits
