Sometimes there\u0027s a mix of different sizes in the same file.\n\nSee the block starting at line 319 in this module for example, which is indented at 4 spaces.\n\n[1] http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html",

Please note that repo was created 2 years before that style guide was.\n\nI may be willing to review a change that updates the indent style globally.  I\u0027d have to ask around first to see if that might break many users (eg, users who have a large set of patches they apply on top of their custom mirror of repo).",
