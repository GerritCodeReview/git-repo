The documentation [1] says:\n\n  The compiled versions of the most recent patterns passed to \n  re.match(), re.search() or re.compile() are cached, so programs \n  that use only a few regular expressions at a time neednâ€™t worry \n  about compiling regular expressions.\n\n[1] http://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#module-contents",
