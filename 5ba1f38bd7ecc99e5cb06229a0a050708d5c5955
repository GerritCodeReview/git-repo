If it exists, it executes as soon as the sync is complete, before the user has a chance to read the hook\u0027s source and determine if it is safe to run as their user account.\n\nGit itself has long avoided a checkout hook that comes as part of the repository, because Linus Torvalds and Junio C Hamano both feel quite strongly that the user should be able to audit the code before it executes locally.  repo init slightly breaks this by fetching repo from the upstream repository, but it only runs a signed version, and users do have the option to point their local ~/bin/repo to use a different upstream repo repository, one that they have already audited the contents of.",
