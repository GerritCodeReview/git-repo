      "message": "would it make more sense to just pass this parameter to _Reload instead of making it a member of the class (especially since you aren\u0027t declaring this in the init)?  I would just make Reload always take a manifest_name parameter that defaults to None.  opt.manifest_name is None when no flag is passed by the user, so you can just pass it directly when calling _Reload.\n\nThat\u0027s my only comment.  Other than that it looks fine.",
